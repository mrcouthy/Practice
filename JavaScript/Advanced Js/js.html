        The variable add is assigned the return value of a self invoking function.
The self-invoking function only runs once. It sets the counter to zero (0), and returns a function expression.
This way add becomes a function. The "wonderful" part is that it can access the counter in the parent scope.
This is called a JavaScript closure. It makes it possible for a function to have "private" variables.
The counter is protected by the scope of the anonymous function, and can only be changed using the add function.

    <div id="cnt"></div>
    <button onclick="closure()">Clickme</button>
    <script>
        function closure()
        {
            document.getElementById("cnt").innerHTML= getCount();
        }
    </script>
</body>
